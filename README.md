# GitHubTesting

Test the GitHub VSCode edit and git features.

Press `.` on your keyboard to get started on this repo.
That will start VSCode in your browser and allow you edit this readme.

* VSCode will auto save your work but will not commit to the repo.
* A changed file notification is shown in left hand menu, prompting you to click that icon to enter a commit message.
* The 'normal' GitHub flow is initiated in the browser, fork, create a branch, and create a PR.

If you create a PR against this repo, I will edit the `main` branch to create a conflict that prevents automatic merging.


TBD: resolve conflicts
